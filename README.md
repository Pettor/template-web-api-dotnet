## Web API Template for Dotnet

### Using the .NET CLI

Open up your Command Prompt / Powershell and run the following command to install the solution template.

```powershell
dotnet new --install FullStackHero.WebAPI.Boilerplate
```
This would install the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` template globally on your machine. With that done, let's see how you can start generating complete .NET WebAPI Solutions seamlessly.

Simply navigate to a new directory (wherever you want to place your new solution), and open up Command Prompt at the opened directory.

Run the following command. Note that, in this demonstration, I am naming my new solution as `FSH.Starter`.

```powershell
dotnet new fsh-api -o FSH.Starter
```
